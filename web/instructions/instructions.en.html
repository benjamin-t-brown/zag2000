  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <h3>Objective</h3>
  <p>
    Make it through all the cards in the deck without your hp reaching 0.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the game starts, four cards are drawn from the deck and placed at the top. One at a time, select a card from
    the top row and play it. These cards can be one of the following:<br><br>

    - <strong>Hearts</strong>: These are potion cards that heal you for the hp of the number on the card. When you
    select one, you will be healed up to your maximum hp of 20.<br>
    - <strong>Diamond</strong>: These are weapon cards. When you select one it will become your current weapon,
    replacing any other weapon you may have already had.<br>
    - <strong>Clubs</strong> & <strong>Spades</strong>: These are monster cards which must be defeated and can damage
    you, reducing your hp. When you select one, you take damage equal to the number on the monster card, unless you are
    using a weapon. See combat section.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you have played 3 cards from the top row, then three more cards will be drawn from the deck and placed at the
    top. You will continue to play cards until you have played all the cards in the deck. If you run out of hp, the game
    is over and you will have to start again. If you make it through all the cards in the deck without your hp reaching
    0, you win.
  </p>
  <h3>Combat</h3>
  <p>
    When you select a monster card, you will take damage equal to the number on the monster
    card. If you have a weapon, you will take damage equal to the number on the monster card minus the number on your
    weapon card. If the number on the monster card is less than the number on your weapon card, you will take no damage.
    If the number on the monster card is greater than the number on your weapon card, you will take damage equal to the
    difference.<br><br>
    After defeating a monster, the card will become attached to your weapon. For any subsequent monster you battle, you
    may only use this weapon card if the monster you are facing has a smaller value than the last monster you defeated.
  </p>
  <h3>Flee</h3>
  <p>
    If you have not played any cards from the top row after they have been dealt, you may choose
    to flee. This will remove them from the top row and in random order, place them at the bottom of the deck. You can
    do this any number of times, but you cannot flee two times in a row.
